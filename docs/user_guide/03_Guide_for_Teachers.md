# User Guide 3: A Guide for Teachers

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for the most common tasks performed by a Teacher in the OBE Portal.

## Your Primary Goal

As a Teacher, your main responsibility is to manage the academic and assessment data for your assigned courses. This involves defining what students should learn (COs), creating assessments to measure that learning, and recording their performance.

## Step 1: Accessing Your Course

1.  After logging in and selecting your Program and Batch, you will land on your **Teacher Dashboard**.
2.  Your dashboard lists all the courses you are assigned to.
3.  Click the **"Manage Course"** button next to the course you wish to work on. This will take you to the **Course Detail** page.

## Step 2: Managing Course Outcomes (COs)

The first step in setting up a course is defining its learning outcomes.

1.  On the Course Detail page, click on the **"COs"** tab.
2.  You will see a table of existing Course Outcomes.
3.  **To add a new CO:**
    -   Use the form at the bottom of the table. The "CO Code" (e.g., CO4) will be suggested automatically.
    -   Enter the "Description" for the new outcome (e.g., "Students will be able to analyze a simple circuit").
    -   Click the "Add" button.
4.  **To edit or delete a CO:** Use the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons in the corresponding row.

> **Important:** All changes you make on this tab (adding, editing, deleting) are temporary. A **Save Bar** will appear at the bottom of the screen. You must click **"Save Changes"** on this bar to make your updates permanent. Clicking "Cancel" will discard all your changes.

## Step 3: Creating Assessments

Assessments are created for specific class sections.

1.  Navigate to the **"Assessments"** tab.
2.  Select the **Section** (e.g., "Section A") you want to create an assessment for from the dropdown menu.
3.  Click the **"Create Assessment"** button.
4.  In the popup modal, give the assessment a **Name** (e.g., "Sessional Test 1") and select its **Type** ("Internal" or "External"). Click **Create**.

## Step 4: Adding Questions and Mapping to COs

Once an assessment is created, you must add questions and link them to the COs they measure.

1.  From the assessments list, click **"Manage Questions"** on the assessment you just created. This takes you to the **Assessment Details** screen.
2.  **To add questions:**
    -   Use the form at the bottom of the table to add questions one by one, specifying the **Question Name** (e.g., Q1, Q2a) and **Max Marks**.
    -   Alternatively, you can click **"Upload Questions"** to add multiple questions from a pre-formatted Excel file.
3.  **To map questions to COs:**
    -   The main table shows your questions as rows and the course's COs as columns.
    -   For each question, check the box under the CO(s) it is designed to assess. A single question can map to multiple COs.
4.  Just like with COs, all changes to questions and their mappings are temporary until you click **"Save Changes"** on the **Save Bar**.

## Step 5: The Grading Workflow

This is the process for entering student marks.

1.  On the **Assessment Details** screen, find the "Upload Student Marks" section.
2.  **Download the Template:** Click the **"Download Template"** button. This will give you an Excel file pre-populated with the student list for that section and columns for each question you created.
3.  **Enter Marks:** Open the Excel file and enter the marks each student received for each question. Save the file.
4.  **Upload Marks:** Click the **"Upload Marks"** button and select your completed Excel file. The system will automatically parse the file and record the scores.

Once marks are uploaded, the system has all the data it needs to automatically calculate CO and PO attainment. You can view the results for your course in the "CO Attainments" tab or by generating a report from the "Reports" page.
