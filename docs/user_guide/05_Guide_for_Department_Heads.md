# User Guide 5: A Guide for Department Heads

This guide covers the specific features and responsibilities of the Department Head role. As a Department Head, you have a high-level administrative view over all programs, faculty, and students within your college or department.

## Your Primary Goal

Your main responsibilities are managing the faculty hierarchy (assigning Program Co-ordinators and Teachers) and overseeing the organization of the student body (managing sections and assignments).

## 1. Navigation and Filtering

Upon logging in, you are taken directly to the main dashboard. Your college is automatically selected in the sidebar. You can use the **Program** and **Batch** dropdowns in the sidebar to filter the data you see across the entire application.

## 2. Managing Faculty Hierarchy

This is your primary administrative task, ensuring the reporting structure is correctly defined.

-   **Location:** `Department > Faculty Management` page from the sidebar.

This page is split into two sections:

### 2.1. Program Co-ordinator (PC) Assignments

Here, you assign a PC to be in charge of each program within your department.

1.  The top table lists all programs in your college.
2.  Next to each program is a dropdown menu containing a list of all users with the "Program Co-ordinator" role who report to you.
3.  Select the appropriate PC for each program.
4.  These changes are not saved automatically. A **Save Bar** will appear at the bottom. Click **"Save Changes"** to confirm your assignments.

### 2.2. Teacher Assignments to Co-ordinators

Here, you define which PC(s) each teacher reports to.

1.  The bottom table lists all teachers associated with your department.
2.  For each teacher, you will see which PC(s) they are currently assigned to.
3.  Click the **"Manage"** button next to a teacher's name.
4.  A popup modal will appear, listing all the PCs in your department with checkboxes.
5.  Select one or more PCs that this teacher reports to. A teacher can report to multiple PCs if they teach courses in different programs.
6.  Click **"Save Assignments"** in the modal. These changes are saved immediately.

## 3. Managing Student Sections and Assignments

This page gives you the tools to organize students into class sections for a given batch.

-   **Location:** `Department > Student Management` page from the sidebar.

### 3.1. Selecting Context

First, use the dropdowns at the top of the page to select the **Program** and **Batch** you want to manage. The rest of the page will populate with data based on your selection.

### 3.2. Managing Sections

1.  In the "Manage Sections" area, you can see a list of existing sections for the selected batch.
2.  To create a new section, enter a name (e.g., "C") in the "Add New Section" form and click the button.
3.  You can delete a section using the trash can icon. This will un-assign all students from that section.

### 3.3. Assigning Students

1.  The main table on the page lists all students in the selected program who are either unassigned or belong to a section in the selected batch.
2.  For each student, you can use the dropdown menu in the **"Assigned Section"** column to place them into one of the sections you created.
3.  You can also change a student's **Status** between "Active" and "Inactive".
4.  These changes are not saved automatically. Use the **Save Bar** at the bottom to **"Save Changes"** or **"Cancel"**.
