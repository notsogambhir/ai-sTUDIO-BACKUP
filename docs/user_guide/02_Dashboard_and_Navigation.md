# User Guide 2: Dashboard and Navigation

This guide explains the main dashboard views and how to use the primary navigation elements—the Header and the Sidebar—to move around the application and filter data.

## 1. The Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you see after setting up your session. Its content is tailored to your specific role.

### 1.1. Standard Dashboard (For PC, Department, Admin, University Roles)

For most managerial and administrative roles, the dashboard provides a high-level statistical overview of the selected program.

-   **Stat Cards:** At the top, you will see four cards displaying key metrics:
    -   **Courses in Program:** The total number of courses defined for the selected program.
    -   **Students in Program:** The total number of students enrolled.
    -   **Program Outcomes:** The number of POs defined for the program.
    -   **Courses to Assess:** The number of active or completed courses requiring assessment data.
-   **Quick Actions:** Below the cards, you'll find buttons for common tasks, such as "Manage Courses" or "View Reports," allowing you to quickly jump to key workflows.

### 1.2. Teacher Dashboard (For Teacher Role)

If you are logged in as a Teacher, you will see a personalized dashboard focused on your direct responsibilities.

-   **Upcoming Tasks:** A section for important reminders and deadlines (e.g., marks submission dates).
-   **My Assigned Courses:** A list of all courses you are assigned to teach. Each course card includes:
    -   The course name and code.
    -   A summary of the status of its assessments (e.g., "Marks Uploaded" or "Pending").
    -   A direct link to "Manage Course" to access its details.

## 2. Navigating the Portal

### 2.1. The Header (Top Bar)

The Header provides context and essential session controls.

-   **Program & Batch Display:** The top-left corner always shows which program and batch you are currently viewing.
-   **User Information:** Your name, role, and ID are displayed on the right.
-   **Program Selection Button (Grid Icon):** For Teachers and PCs, this button takes you back to the Program Selection screen, allowing you to switch to a different program without logging out.
-   **Logout Button:** Securely ends your session and returns you to the login screen.

### 2.2. The Sidebar (Left Menu)

The Sidebar is your primary tool for navigation and, for some roles, for filtering data across the entire portal.

-   **Navigation Links:** The main body of the sidebar contains a list of links to the application's pages. The links you see are determined by your role. For example, an Admin will see "User Management," while a Teacher will not. The currently active page is highlighted in blue.

-   **Global Filters (For Admin, University, Department Roles):**
    If you are a high-level user, the top of the sidebar contains three cascading dropdown menus:
    1.  **College:** Select a college to view its data. A Department Head's college is pre-selected and locked.
    2.  **Program:** After selecting a college, this dropdown populates with the programs within that college.
    3.  **Batch:** After selecting a program, this dropdown populates with the available batches for that program.

    Changing these filters updates the **entire application's context**. All pages—from the Dashboard to the Student List—will refresh to show data only for the selected college, program, and batch. This is a powerful tool for drilling down into the specific area of the institution you want to analyze.
