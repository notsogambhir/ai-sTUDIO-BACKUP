# User Guide 7: Understanding Reports

The NBA OBE Portal's primary function is to simplify accreditation by generating detailed, accurate, and downloadable reports. This guide explains how to use the "Attainment Reports" page.

-   **Location:** `Reports` page from the sidebar.

## 1. The Report Dashboard

The page is an interactive dashboard designed to help you generate the specific report you need. The process involves three simple steps.

### Step 1: Select a Report Type

The top section displays a series of tiles, each representing a different type of report you can generate. Click on a tile to select it. The selected tile will be highlighted with a blue border.

-   **Course Attainment Summary:** This is the most comprehensive report for a single course. It includes an overall summary of CO attainment levels and a detailed student-by-student breakdown of performance.
-   **Assessment Comparison Report:** This report provides a side-by-side comparison of student percentage scores across all assessments in a course, making it easy to see performance trends.

### Step 2: Set Filters

Once you select a report type, the "Set Filters" section will become active. Here you can narrow down the data for your report.

-   **Course:** Select the specific course you want to report on from the dropdown menu. This is required for most report types.
-   **Scope:** This filter allows you to define the student cohort for the report.
    -   **Overall Course:** Includes all students in the selected batch who are enrolled in the course.
    -   **Section [Name]:** Narrows the report to include only the students from a specific class section.

### Step 3: Generate Report

After setting your filters, click the **"Generate Report"** button.

## 2. Previewing and Downloading Your Report

Clicking "Generate Report" will open a full-screen **Report Preview** modal.

-   **Review:** The modal displays the full report exactly as it will appear in the final document. You can scroll through the content to ensure it's what you need. The report includes a professional header with all the relevant context (program, batch, course, etc.).

-   **Download PDF:** When you are satisfied with the preview, click the **"Download PDF"** button in the top-right corner.
    -   The system will generate a multi-page PDF document of the report.
    -   Your browser will then prompt you to save the file. The filename will be automatically generated based on the report title and course.

-   **Close:** Click the "Close" button to exit the preview modal without downloading.

This workflow allows you to quickly generate and validate different reports, providing the documentation needed for meetings, reviews, and official NBA accreditation submissions.
