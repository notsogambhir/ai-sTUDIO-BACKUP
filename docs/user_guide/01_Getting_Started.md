# User Guide 1: Getting Started

Welcome to the NBA Outcome Based Education (OBE) Portal! This guide will walk you through logging in, selecting your workspace, and understanding the basic layout of the application.

## 1. Logging In

The login screen is your entry point to the portal.

1.  **Username:** Enter the username provided to you by the administrator.
2.  **Password:** Enter your password.
3.  **College:** Select the college you are associated with from the dropdown menu. This is important as it helps set the initial context for your session.
4.  **Click LOGIN.**

> **Tip:** For demonstration purposes, a list of demo usernames is provided on the login screen. The password for all demo accounts is "password".

## 2. Program & Batch Selection

For most roles (like Teacher and Program Co-ordinator), after logging in, you will be directed to the **Program Selection Screen**. This step is crucial because it tells the portal which specific academic program and batch you want to work with.

1.  **Welcome Message:** The screen will greet you and confirm your name, role, and the college you logged into.
2.  **Select a Program:** Click on the card corresponding to the program you wish to manage (e.g., "BE ECE").
3.  **Select a Batch:** A popup modal will appear, prompting you to select a specific batch (e.g., "2025-2029") from a dropdown list. Click **Proceed**.

After completing this step, you will be taken to the main application dashboard, fully configured for the program and batch you selected.

> **Note for Admins, University, and Department Heads:** You will bypass this screen and be taken directly to the main dashboard. You will use the dropdown filters in the sidebar to select the college, program, and batch you wish to view.

## 3. The Main Application Interface

Once inside, the application is divided into three main areas:

1.  **Header (Top):**
    -   Displays the name of the program and batch you are currently working with.
    -   Shows your user information (Name, Role, Employee ID).
    -   Contains the **Program Selection** (grid icon) and **Logout** buttons.

2.  **Sidebar (Left):**
    -   This is your main navigation menu. It contains links to all the pages and features you have permission to access.
    -   For high-level roles, this area also contains the dropdown filters for selecting College, Program, and Batch.

3.  **Main Content Area (Center):**
    -   This is your workspace. It displays the content of the page you have selected from the sidebar, whether it's the Dashboard, a list of courses, or a detailed report.
