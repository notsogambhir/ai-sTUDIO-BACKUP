# User Guide 4: A Guide for Program Co-ordinators (PCs)

This guide covers the key responsibilities and workflows for a Program Co-ordinator. The PC role is central to the OBE process, overseeing the entire curriculum for a specific program.

## Your Primary Goal

As a PC, you are responsible for the end-to-end management of your program's curriculum, faculty, and outcomes. You can perform all the actions of a Teacher, plus several higher-level management tasks.

## Core Workflows (Shared with Teachers)

First, ensure you are familiar with the fundamental workflows, as you will be responsible for overseeing them:

-   **Managing Course Outcomes (COs):** Adding/editing COs for any course in your program.
-   **Managing Assessments:** Creating assessments, adding questions, and mapping them to COs.
-   **Uploading Marks:** Ensuring student performance data is entered into the system.

(Refer to the **Guide for Teachers** for step-by-step instructions on these tasks.)

## PC-Specific Workflows

### 1. Managing Courses for Your Program

You have full control over the courses offered in your program.

-   **Location:** `Courses` page from the sidebar.
-   **To Add a New Course:**
    1.  Use the "Add Course" form at the top of the page.
    2.  Provide a unique **Course Code** and **Course Name**.
    3.  Click "Add Course". The course will be created with a "Future" status.
-   **To Bulk-Upload Courses:** Use the "Bulk Upload" button to add multiple courses at once from an Excel file.
-   **To Activate a Course:**
    1.  Find the course in the "Future" or "Completed" list.
    2.  Use the status dropdown in the course's row to change its status to **"Active"**.
    3.  **Important:** A confirmation will appear, warning you that activating the course will automatically enroll all active students from the selected batch. This is the primary way students are added to a course.

### 2. Managing Program Outcomes (POs)

You are responsible for defining the high-level outcomes for your entire program.

-   **Location:** `Program Outcomes` page from the sidebar.
-   **To Add a New PO:**
    1.  Click the "Add New PO" button.
    2.  In the popup modal, provide a **PO Number** (e.g., "PO5") and its full **Description**.
    3.  Click "Add PO".

### 3. Mapping COs to POs

This is a critical step where you define how individual course learning contributes to the overall program goals.

-   **Location:** Navigate to a specific course's detail page and click the **"CO-PO Mapping"** tab.
-   **How it Works:** You will see a matrix with your Course Outcomes (COs) as rows and your Program Outcomes (POs) as columns.
-   **To Create a Mapping:** In each cell, use the dropdown to select the strength of the relationship:
    -   **1:** Low (the CO slightly supports the PO)
    -   **2:** Medium (the CO moderately supports the PO)
    -   **3:** High (the CO strongly supports the PO)
    -   **- (or 0):** No correlation.
-   Remember to click **"Save Changes"** on the Save Bar to commit your mappings.

### 4. Assigning Faculty to Courses

You can assign a primary teacher to a course or different teachers to different sections.

-   **Location:** Navigate to a specific course's detail page and click the **"Faculty Assignment"** tab.
-   **Two Modes:**
    1.  **Single Teacher:** Assign one teacher to be responsible for the entire course.
    2.  **Assign by Section:** Assign a different teacher to each specific class section (e.g., Prof. Smith teaches Section A, and Prof. Davis teaches Section B). An assignment here will override the main course teacher for that section.
-   Use the dropdowns to select from a list of teachers who report to you.
-   Remember to click **"Save Changes"** on the Save Bar.

### 5. Viewing Reports and Attainment

You have access to all reports and attainment dashboards for your program, allowing you to monitor its effectiveness and prepare for accreditation. (See the **Understanding Reports** guide for more details).
