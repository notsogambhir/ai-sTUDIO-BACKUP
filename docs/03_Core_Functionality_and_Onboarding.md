## 2. Onboarding and Navigation: A User Guide

This section walks a new user through their first session with the portal.

### 2.1. Step 1: Logging In

The login screen is your entry point to the portal.

1.  **Username:** Enter the username provided to you by the administrator.
2.  **Password:** Enter your password.
3.  **College:** Select the college you are associated with.
4.  **Click LOGIN.**

> **Tip:** For demonstration, a list of demo usernames is provided on the login screen. The password for all demo accounts is "password".

### 2.2. Step 2: Program & Batch Selection (For Teachers & PCs)

If you are a Teacher or Program Co-ordinator, you must select your workspace.

1.  **Select a Program:** On the Program Selection Screen, click on the card for the program you wish to manage (e.g., "BE ECE").
2.  **Select a Batch:** A popup will appear. Select a batch (e.g., "2025-2029") from the dropdown and click **Proceed**.

You will now be on the main application dashboard, configured for your selection.

> **Note:** Admins, University, and Department Heads bypass this screen and use sidebar filters instead.

### 2.3. Step 3: Understanding the Main Interface

The application is divided into three main areas:

1.  **Header (Top):**
    -   Displays your current context (Program and Batch).
    -   Shows your user information.
    -   Contains the **Program Selection** (grid icon) and **Logout** buttons.

2.  **Sidebar (Left):**
    -   Your main navigation menu. Links are tailored to your role.
    -   For high-level roles, this area also contains the global dropdown filters for College, Program, and Batch. Changing these filters updates the entire application's view.

3.  **Main Content Area (Center):**
    -   This is your workspace. It displays the content of the page you have selected from the sidebar.

### 2.4. Step 4: The Dashboard

The Dashboard is your landing page and provides a summary based on your role.

-   **Standard Dashboard (PC, Admin, etc.):** Shows statistical cards with key metrics (total courses, students, etc.) for the selected program and quick action buttons.
-   **Teacher Dashboard:** A personalized view showing your assigned courses and the status of their assessments.
