# PRD 1: Introduction and Goals

## 1. Introduction

The **NBA Outcome Based Education (OBE) Portal** is a comprehensive web application designed for educational institutions to manage, track, and calculate learning outcomes in accordance with the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) guidelines. It serves as a centralized platform for faculty and administrators to manage curriculum data, record student performance, and automate the complex process of calculating Course Outcome (CO) and Program Outcome (PO) attainment.

## 2. Problem Statement

Accreditation bodies like the NBA mandate a rigorous, data-driven approach to education, known as Outcome Based Education. The process involves:
- Defining specific learning outcomes for each course (COs) and for the overall program (POs).
- Mapping course-level outcomes to program-level outcomes.
- Continuously assessing student performance against these outcomes.
- Calculating and documenting attainment levels to prove curriculum effectiveness.

For most institutions, this process is manual, relying on a labyrinth of spreadsheets, documents, and disparate data sources. This approach is:
- **Time-Consuming:** Faculty and co-ordinators spend countless hours on data entry, aggregation, and repetitive calculations.
- **Error-Prone:** Manual data handling is susceptible to human error, which can jeopardize the accuracy of attainment reports.
- **Opaque:** It is difficult to get a clear, real-time overview of student performance or curriculum effectiveness across different courses and batches.
- **Inefficient for Reporting:** Compiling the necessary evidence and reports for NBA audits is a monumental and stressful task.

The NBA OBE Portal aims to solve these problems by providing a single, streamlined, and automated solution.

## 3. Vision & Goals

**Vision:** To be the definitive digital tool for educational institutions to seamlessly implement and manage Outcome Based Education, transforming the accreditation process from a burdensome chore into a continuous quality improvement cycle.

### Primary Goals
- **Automate Attainment Calculation:** To completely eliminate manual calculations for both CO and PO attainment, providing instant, accurate results based on student assessment data.
- **Centralize Data Management:** To create a single source of truth for all academic data, including curriculum structure, user roles, student information, assessments, and outcomes.
- **Streamline Accreditation Reporting:** To generate comprehensive, downloadable reports that are aligned with NBA requirements, drastically reducing the time and effort needed for compliance.

### Secondary Goals
- **Enhance Faculty Productivity:** To free up faculty members from administrative overhead, allowing them to focus more on teaching and student mentorship.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** To offer clear dashboards and visualizations that help administrators and faculty identify curriculum gaps, underperforming areas, and opportunities for improvement.
- **Ensure Consistency and Standardization:** To enforce a consistent methodology for defining, mapping, and assessing outcomes across all departments and programs within an institution.

## 4. Target Audience

The portal is designed for several key user roles within an academic institution:

| Role | Primary Need |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | To configure the entire system's academic structure (colleges, programs) and manage all user accounts and permissions. |
| **University Leadership** | To get a high-level, cross-college overview of program performance and attainment metrics. |
| **Department Head** | To manage faculty assignments (PCs, Teachers) and oversee student section management within their college/department. |
| **Program Co-ordinator (PC)** | To manage the curriculum for a specific program, including courses, COs, POs, and teacher assignments. This role is central to the OBE process. |
| **Teacher / Faculty** | To manage their assigned courses, create assessments, map questions to COs, upload student marks, and view attainment data for their specific classes. |
