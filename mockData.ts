/**
 * @file mockData.ts
 * @description
 * This file is intentionally left empty.
 *
 * Why is it empty? A little history story!
 * Imagine this file was our first, handwritten recipe book for all the data in our application
 * (like a list of users, courses, etc.). It worked, but it was a bit clunky.
 *
 * We decided to upgrade to a much nicer, professionally printed cookbook called `mockData.json`.
 * This new cookbook is better because the application can "read" from it in a way that is
 * more like how a real application gets its data from the internet. It even allows us to
 * show a "Loading..." screen while the app is "reading the recipe," which is more realistic.
 *
 * So, why do we keep this old, empty recipe book around?
 * It's kept here just in case some very old part of our code still remembers it. By keeping the
 * file here, we prevent the app from showing an error like "I can't find the old recipe book!".
 *
 * In short: This file is a relic of the past and is no longer used for cooking (running the app).
 * It's considered **deprecated**.
