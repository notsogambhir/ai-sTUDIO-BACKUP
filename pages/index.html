  @description
  This is the very first file the web browser opens when someone visits our website.
  Think of it as the blueprint for a house before we start building. It sets up the
  basic structure and tells the browser what tools and materials (like styles and scripts)
  it needs to build our beautiful application.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This line says, "Hey browser, I'm a modern webpage using the latest HTML rules (HTML5)." -->
<html lang="en" class="h-full">
  <!-- The <head> is like the "brain" or "control room" of the page.
       It contains all the important information that you don't see on the screen,
       but it tells the browser how to work, what the page is called, and where to find its tools. -->
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    
    <!-- This is the little picture (like a tiny logo) that you see in the browser tab. -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://d1hbpr09pwz0sk.cloudfront.net/logo_url/chitkara-university-4c35e411" />
    
    <!-- This is a special instruction for mobile phones. It tells them, "Make the page fit
         the width of your screen, and don't try to zoom out." This makes the app look good on phones. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    
    <!-- This is the text that appears as the title in the browser tab. -->
    <title>NBA OBE Portal</title>
    
    <!-- SCRIPT TOOLBOXES -->
    <!-- These lines are like telling the browser, "Before you do anything else, go to these
         internet addresses and grab these toolboxes for me. I'll need them later." -->

    <!-- 1. TailwindCSS: This is our giant box of digital crayons, stickers, and building blocks for styling.
         It gives us all the easy-to-use classes (like "bg-blue-500" for a blue background) that let us
         make our app look nice without writing a lot of custom CSS code. -->
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    
    <!-- 2. SheetJS (xlsx): This is our "Excel expert" toolbox. It's a special library that
         knows how to read and understand Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx). We use this for all the
         "Upload Excel" buttons in our app. -->
    <script src="https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-latest/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
    
    <!-- 3. PDF Generation Libraries: These two toolboxes work together like a photographer and a printer.
         - html2canvas: This is the "photographer". It knows how to take a perfect, high-quality
           "screenshot" of a part of our webpage.
         - jsPDF: This is the "printer". It takes the screenshot from html2canvas and turns it into
           a beautiful, multi-page PDF file that the user can download.
         The 'defer' attribute is a special instruction that says: "You can download these toolboxes
         now, but please wait until the rest of the page is fully built before you open them."
         This is very important because it prevents errors where our app might try to use a tool
         before it's ready. -->
    <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2canvas/1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js"></script>
    <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>
    
    <!-- This is our app's "address book" or "map". It tells the browser that whenever our
         main code (`index.tsx`) asks for a big, important tool like "react" or "react-router-dom",
         it should go to these specific internet addresses to find them. This is how our app
         gets the core React library that makes everything work. -->
  <script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0",
    "react-dom/": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/",
    "react/": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0/",
    "chart.js": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.2/+esm",
    "react-chartjs-2": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-chartjs-2@5.2.0/+esm",
    "react-router-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-router-dom@6.23.1"
  }
}
</script>

<!-- PRINT-ONLY STYLES -->
<!-- This is a special set of rules that only apply when the user tries to print the page (or save as PDF).
     It's like a magic costume the page puts on just before it goes to the printer. Its main job is to
     make the final paper copy look clean and professional by hiding everything that shouldn't be on it,
     like buttons, sidebars, and headers, so that only the report itself is visible. -->
<style type="text/css" media="print">
    /* Rule 1: When printing, make everything on the page invisible by default. */
    body * {
        visibility: hidden;
    }
    /* Rule 2: But, find the special area we marked as 'printable-area' and make IT and everything
       inside it visible again. This is how we select only the report. */
    .printable-area, .printable-area * {
        visibility: visible;
    }
    /* Rule 3: Make sure our printable area is positioned perfectly at the top-left corner of the paper. */
    .printable-area {
        position: absolute;
        left: 0;
        top: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }
    /* Rule 4: A helper rule to hide any specific little things inside the report that we still
       don't want to print, like a "Print" button. */
    .print\:hidden {
        display: none !important;
    }
</style>

</head>
  <!-- The <body> is the main visible part of the house. Everything you can see on the screen—all
       the furniture, windows, and doors—lives inside here. -->
  <body class="h-full bg-gray-100 text-gray-800" style="transform: scale(0.75); transform-origin: top left; width: 133.33vw; height: 133.33vh;">
    <!-- THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DIV ON THE WHOLE PAGE!
         Think of this `div` with the id "root" as the main stage in a theater. Our entire React application,
         with all its components, pages, and buttons, will be built and "performed" on this stage.
         The `index.tsx` file (our director) looks for this specific stage by its ID to know where to start the show. -->
    <div id="root" class="h-full"></div>
    
    <!-- This is the final step. It's like the director shouting "Action!".
         This script tag tells the browser to go and run our main application code, which lives in `index.tsx`.
         This one line kicks off the entire React app and brings our beautiful page to life. -->
    <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
